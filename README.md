## About Me

I am a passionate learner and developer in the field of cybersecurity, with a particular focus on security tools development and penetration tests execution. I'm still in a early stage of my career and have a lot to learn, however, my curiosity drive me to create new personal projects so I can aquire more pratical experience. With that in mind I hope I can share with you my current projects and join me on this journey of growth and discovery.

## Projects

- **Intrusion Detection System**: I developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as my first security tool. This IDS utilizes a JSON rules file to analyze each packet circulating on the network and identify any suspicious behavior based on predefined rules. For instance, it detects patterns such as an unusually high number of requests to a single port or the download of .exe files. When a suspicious activity is detected, the IDS triggers an alert, enabling prompt action to mitigate potential threats.
